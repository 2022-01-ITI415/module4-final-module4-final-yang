# 09-14-module3-SNAPS-Base
This project will house scenes for level design, interiors and exteriors, lighting, audio and particle systems,

This is an exploration game where the player explores the island. I get players to explore by playing crystals to indirectly show them where to go, as well as have a collectible "Wisp" that directly shows players where to go. These Wisps appear and disappear in a specific order when the player touches them. To make the Wisps an obvious guiding tool, I made their color purple to distinguish them from the environment, and I also gave them an animation to move up and down. Movement in an entirely static environment will pop out and attract the player's attention. 

## Scene List
- MainMenu - provide access to other scenes
- Probuilder - basic use of probuilder to get comfortable with core functions -> the shrines
- Snaps - using Modern Office and Sci-Fi Industrial props and structure for level creation -> the cave building
- Terrain - exterior level modeling, texturing , -> the map
- Lighting-direct - experiments with direct lighting types -> changed directional light intesity
- Lighting-indirect - experiments with indirect lighting and lightmap baking -> wisp light
- Audio - experiments with 2D and 3D audio
- Particle systems - everything that looks cool that isn't geometry or texture -> wisp
- Prototype 3 - Bringing it all together in a small exploration/collection game
